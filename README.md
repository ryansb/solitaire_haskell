# Solitaire -- Haskell

A Haskell implementation of [Solitaire encryption][sol] used in the novel
Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson. The algorithm was written by Bruce Schneier
and its Perl implementation is tested by Counterpane Security

This version is tested against the Perl implementation, but is (obviously) not
guaranteed or audited in any meaningful way.
